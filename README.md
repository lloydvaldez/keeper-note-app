A note taking app built using React. This is the first project that introduced me to React.

## What I've learned from this project
This help me understand so many things about React. I mean hooks, states, components etc.
Practicing so many aspects of this library (my first JS library) really help me understand how to use React properly.
That being said it was so much fun dipping my toes in React, a lot data to take in but a pleasure of learning it.
